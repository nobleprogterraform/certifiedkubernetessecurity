- let's see how we can create custom application specific profiles from scratch
as an example let us make use of a simple bash scrip that creates directoriies under the /opt file system and then writes into a file within this directory 
A simple bash script add_data.sh:
#!/bin/bash
data_directory=/opt/app/data
mkdir -p ${data_directory}
echo "=>  File created at `date`" | tee $(data_directory) create.log

- now let's see how we can create app armor profile for this specific script
instead of manually creating the profile we can leverage tools provided by apparmor and to do this there is first install the app armor utils package: sudo apt install  apparmor-utils -y

Create a profile for bash script:
aa-genprof /root/add_data.sh

Run a bash script from a different window:
./add_data.sh

To Verify the profile is loaded: apparmor_parser /etc/apparmor.d/root.add_data.sh
