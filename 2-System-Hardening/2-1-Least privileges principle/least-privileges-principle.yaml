3.1 Least privileges principle
	- Lets consider an example of airport operations, in this simple analogy there are several entities involved in a secure and successful operation of an airport all. There are various degree of access and privileges.
	- let's talk about the traveler, traveller has unrestricted access to the public spaces of the airport once the checkin process is complete
	traveler can then use the designated gate to board aircraft.
	- the baggage employees have the privilege to inspect the belongings of a traveler. usually their access is restricted to the security area but of course they can also access the public spaces of the airport.
	- the store employees may have additional access to the back room of the store and of course besides the store itself they also have access to the public spaces of the airport
	- As you can see every user has minimum privileges to carry out their job allows for an efficient and secure operation of this Airport
	
	
	This is the Foundation of the least privilege principle at the same can be applied to any computer system including the Linux operating system as well as to secure our kubernetes infrastructure.
	we can use the same principle of least privilege so that systems include nodes or software running on them and workloads only have the Bare minimum access such as limiting users and accounts that can use the cluster
	- Apart from users we can also secure env by Making sure that only the required software is installed on the Host.
	Ensuring that unwanted services are not exposed on the nodes. Making sure that certain kernel modules cannot be loaded on the nodes and identifying and fixing any open ports of the system
