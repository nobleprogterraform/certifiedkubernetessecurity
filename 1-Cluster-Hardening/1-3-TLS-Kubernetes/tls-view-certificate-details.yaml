7.6 View Certificate details:
	- So you join a new team to help them manage their Kubernetes environment.
		You're a new administrator to this team. You've been told that there are multiple issues related to certificates in the environment.
		So you're asked to perform a health check of all the certificates in the entire cluster
	- First of all, it's important to know how the cluster was set up.There are different solutions available
		for deploying a Kubernetes cluster, and they use different methods to generate and manage certificates.
		If you were to deploy a Kubernetes cluster from scratch you generate all the certificates by yourself,
		as we did in the previous lecture. Or else, if you were to rely on an automated provisioning tool like Cube ADM,
		it takes care of automatically generating and configuring the cluster for you. While you deploy all the components
		as native services on the notes in the hard way, the Cube ADM tool deploys these as pods.So it's important to know where to look at,
		to view the right information.
	-  For the Cube API server definition file under /etsy/kubernetes/manifests folder. The command used to start the API server has information
		about all the certificates it uses. For example, to view API server certificate file.Run the open SSL X509 command and provide the certificate
		file as input to decode the certificate and view details. 
		openssl x509 -in /etc/kuber/pki/apiserver.crt -text -noout
	- If you set up the cluster from scratch by yourself and the services are configured as "native services" in the OS, you wanna start looking 
		at the service logs using the operating systems logging functionality. 
		command: journalctl -u etcd.service -l
		In case you set up the cluster with Cube ADM
		then the various components are deployed as pods. So you can look at the logs,using the cube control logs command followed
		by the pod name. kubectl logs etcd-cluster
		Sometimes if the core components, such as, the Kubernetes API server or the NCD server are down,
		the cube control commands won't function. In that case, you have to go one level down to Docker to fetch the logs.
		List all the containers using the Docker PS-A command (docker ps -a) and then view the logs using the Docker logs command
		followed by the container ID. docker logs 87fc
