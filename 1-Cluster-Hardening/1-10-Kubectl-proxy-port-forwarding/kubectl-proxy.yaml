- In this lecture we will take a look at the kubectl proxy in a bit more detail. we can use the kubectl utility to interact with the kubernetes API server and when doing so we don't need to provide any authentication mechanism in the command line because we can figure it in the kube config file on our system. we learned that kube config file has been necessary user details and credentials in it to access and interact with the kubernetes clusters through the API server
	- now the kubectl utility could be anywhere it may be on the same host as the master node in the kubernetes cluster,it may be elsewhere say on our laptop so the cluster could be within a VM on my laptop or on a private server in the environment or a server on public cloud environment or it could be from some managed kubernetes service provider and no matter where the cluster is hosted you can manage it locally using the cube kubectl utility from your laptop as long as you have valid kube config file.
	- We also discussed that another way to interact with the kubernetes API server is through the port 6443 using curl.so say if you were to access the API server directly through using curl (curl https://localhost:6443/api/v1/pods) then you will not be allowed access as you have not specified any mean authentication mechanisms so you have to authenticate to the API server using your certificate files by passing them in the command line.
	- Alternative option is start the kubectl proxy server.The kubectl proxy client launches a proxy service locally on port 8001 by default and uses the credentials and certificates from your kube config file to access the cluster. that way you don't have to specify those in the curl command when you try to access the API server but now when you access the kubectl process service on localhost and 48,001 the proxy will use the credentials from the cubeconfig file stored on your local computer and forward your request to the kube API server and this will list all available apis and route so this is an alternate way of accessing
	- remember that the proxy runs only on your laptop and if only accessible within your laptop
	- Another option to access the service is to configure a port forward. now with kubectl you could forward a port from your laptop to port on a service within the kubernetes cluster. the kubectl port forward command takes a pod,deployment or replicas that are service as an argument in this case the service nginx is what we want to forward traffic to and then we specify a port on our host which is 28080 and that is forwarded to 80 on the service which is the service running within a kubernetes cluster, so now to access the service running on the remote cluster we can just do a curl to localhost to 28080 and any request to that particular port is going to be forwarded to the service running within the kubernetes cluster so we can use this approach to access any service at this hosted within cluster as if you are running them on laptop

	- Remember not to confuse between kubectl proxy vs kube proxy as they are 2 different serivces. Kube proxy is used to enable connectivity
		between pods and services across different nodes in the cluster. Whereas Whereas Kube control proxy is an HTTP proxy service created 
		by Kube control utility to access the Kube API server
