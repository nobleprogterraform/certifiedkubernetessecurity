1. The 4 C's of Cloud Native Security
	- The first c in Cloud native security it refers to the security of the entire infrastructure hosting the servers this could be a private or a public cloud and data center hosting physical machines a collocated environment
	- The next is cluster security. Security best practices were followed in securing the docker-demon, the kubernetes API as well as any gui we used to manage the cluster such as the kubernetes dashboard we look into these in much more detail in the first section of the course where we talk about cluster setup and hardening we will see how to secure the kubernetes demon and the kubernetes dashboard as well as other best practices to be followed such as using network policies and security in Ingress
	- Next is container. Installing whatever application you want on it without any restrictions could have been prevented if constraints were put in place to only run images from a secure internal repository and if running containers in privilege mode is disallowed and through sandboxing continues could be isolated in a better way. we discuss these in the minimize micro-service vulnerability section as well as the supply chain securities sections of the course
	- And finally code code refers to the application code itself hard coding applications with database credentials or passing critical information through environment variables or exposing applications without TLS are bad coding practices.
	we do cover some areas such as securing critical information with secrets and vaults and enabling mtls encryption to secure pod to pod communication well that's it for this lecture
